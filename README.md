```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install sklearn
pip install https://github.com/ho4040/keras-pbt
```

then

```python
import pbt

# code with pbt
```

## Getting started

To run the Boston Housing Dataset example, you need Keras with Tensorflow backend. Check any of the `example_boston_ds` files.

We start by training a grid search with a total of 36 combinations of hyperparameters (6 values for l1 and 6 for l2). We choose the initial values for these hyperparameters taking evenly spaced numbers on a log scale (a geometric progression) between two endpoints.

Next, we train populations of different sizes (6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36) with each worker being trained for the same number of steps as each member of the grid search. The workers of a population of size *k* are initialized sampling *k* evenly spaced combinations over the parameter grid, where `k <= len(grid)`. These are the resulting learning curves:

![training_curves](https://github.com/fdiazgon/pbt-keras/blob/assets/training_curves.png?raw=true)

Each worker is represented by a line. Highlighted lines are an average of the top 5 workers at each step. As we increase the size of the population, PBT is capable of finding better hyperparameters, thus increasing the performance gap between both approaches.

In the next image, you can see how the hyperparameters change during training.

![hyperparameter_population](https://github.com/fdiazgon/pbt-keras/blob/assets/hyperparameter_population.png?raw=true)

Figures represent l1 and l2 regularization respectively (in a log scale). You can see how they adopt lower values during training. The same can be visualized in the following figure, where we compare the total search space of PBT and grid search:

![hyperparameter_evolution](https://github.com/fdiazgon/pbt-keras/blob/assets/hyperparameter_evolution.png?raw=true)

As it is obvious, the right figure represents l1 and l2 regularization of the 36 workers in the grid search (they do not change during training). On the other hand, in the left figure, is possible to see how we are exploring values closer to zero (a darker colour represents a value explored in a later stage during training).

It is worth mentioning that the grid search was also performed using the PBT algorithm, the only difference is that, for grid search, we avoid exploring new hyperparameters.

Also, we have tried to avoid any randomness to have a comparison as unbiased as possible (e.g., the starting weights are always the same, train/validation splits always use the same seed, etc.). For example, if in the previous example you train the same population twice without the exploring phase (restarting the Keras session before training again), you should see the same result for all the members.

## Using your own model

When creating a new member, you need to supply a function which accepts no parameters and returns a compiled Keras model. However, to allow PBT to change the hyperparameters, you should use special classes when creating the model. For example:

```python
def build_fn(data_dim, l1=1e-5, l2=1e-5):

  def _build_fn():
      # Set seed to get same weight initialization
      np.random.seed(42)
      model = keras.models.Sequential([
          keras.layers.Dense(64,
                             activation='relu',
                             input_shape=(data_dim,),
                             kernel_regularizer=
                             pbt.hyperparameters.l1_l2(l1, l2)),
          keras.layers.Dense(1,
                             kernel_regularizer=
                             pbt.hyperparameters.l1_l2(l1, l2)),
      ])
      model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
      return model

return _build_fn
```

You can see how the `kernel_regularizer` is an instance of `pbt.hyperparameters.L1L2Mutable`. For now, this is the only available hyperparameter.

Then, you can create your Member like:

```python
pbt.members.Member(build_fn(data_dim, **h), steps_ready=1e2)
```

Where `**h` is just a dictionary with the hyperparameters (e.g., `{'l1': 1e-5, 'l2': 0}`). A Member exposes an interface to train the underlying model and change its hyperparameters. In the examples you can see how to use this interface to implement the PBT algorithm.

## Scientific report

A full [scientific report](report/pbt_scientific_writing.pdf) containing a set of qualitative results was redacted for the KTH course [II2202](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/II2202?l=en) on "Research Methodology and Scientific Writing" in collaboration with [Giorgio Ruffa](https://github.com/xmooner).

## Contributors wanted

* If you think that something could be done in a more clear and concise way, please tell while the project is small. I will gladly hear.

* Add more hyperparameters, but check how L1L2Mutable is implemented before (or propose a new method to include modifiable hyperparameters once the model is compiled).

* Find a new way to check that the `__call__` method of some hyperparameters is actually called. Right now we are capturing a debug logging call (shame).
